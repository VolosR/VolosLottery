# Let's Play ESP32 Lottery
I created a simple Node.js WebSocket application that generates random numbers and sends them to clients. Using this app, I made a lottery game. This game is just for funâ€”you can't earn real money, but you can play with it and test your numbers. I like WebSockets and i will probably make some tutorials.
